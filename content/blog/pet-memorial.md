## 🛠️ 1. Layered Shadow-Memory Box — A Story in Three Dimensions

A **DIY pet memorial shadow box** is timeless, but adding layers turns it into a story of memory and depth.

- **Base layer**: a printed photo of your pet at peace or play.
- **Middle layer**: small keepsakes like their collar tag, bell, or toy suspended on clear tabs.
- **Back layer**: a handwritten message or paw print on translucent paper.
- Add a soft LED strip to let it glow like a quiet night lamp.

Each layer represents a moment in your bond — together, they create a miniature world of remembrance.

## 🌱 2. Living Tribute: A Memorial Plant That Grows with You

Nothing says “life continues” like something that grows.

- Decorate the topsoil with engraved stones, shells, or pressed flower petals.
- Water it gently on anniversaries or special days.

Over time, your plant becomes a living symbol of love — proof that grief and growth can coexist.

- Add a micro etched quote or date inside.
- Finish it smooth and matte.

These **pet remembrance crafts** fit perfectly on a desk or shelf, shining softly when light passes through.
